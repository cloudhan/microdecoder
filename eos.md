During LLM training, like GPT2 or 3 or 4, do we chunk the sample text or do we concat the sample text?

During the training of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2, GPT-3, or GPT-4, both chunking and concatenation of text samples are used, but in different stages of the process.

Chunking: The training data is divided into smaller pieces or “chunks”. This is done because these models are trained on batches of these chunks in parallel for efficiency. The size of the chunks is typically determined by the maximum sequence length that the model can handle. For example, for GPT-2, this is 1024 tokens.
Concatenation: Within each chunk, multiple text samples may be concatenated together. This is done to minimize the impact of boundaries between text samples on the model’s predictions. The model is trained to predict the next token in the sequence, given the previous tokens, and it doesn’t know where the text samples start or end. By concatenating text samples together, the model is encouraged to understand the context that spans multiple samples.
So, in summary, the training data is chunked into smaller pieces, and within each piece, the text samples are concatenated together. This approach allows the model to effectively learn from the large amounts of text data.

So in reality, each sample in the batch, actually can contain multiple text source (span different context) due to the concatenation?
Copilot
由 Copilot 发送:
Yes, that’s correct. Each sample in the batch can contain multiple text sources due to the concatenation. This means that a single sample might span different contexts.

The model is designed to handle this. It’s trained to predict the next token based on the previous tokens, regardless of whether those tokens come from the same text source or different ones. This is part of what makes these models so powerful: they can understand and generate text that is coherent and contextually appropriate, even when the context changes within the sample.

However, it’s important to note that there are certain limitations. For example, if the context changes too abruptly or too often within a sample, it might be more challenging for the model to make accurate predictions. But in general, these models are quite robust to changes in context within a sample.

In this way, will the model learn not to attend to context before a [EOS]  token?
Copilot
由 Copilot 发送:
Yes, that’s correct. The [EOS] token, which stands for “End of Sentence”, is used in these models to indicate the end of a text sample. When the model encounters an [EOS] token, it understands that the following token will be the start of a new text sample, which may have a different context.

During training, the model learns to associate the [EOS] token with a transition in context. As a result, it does not typically use the context before an [EOS] token to inform its predictions after the [EOS] token. This is a form of “context isolation” that helps the model handle the concatenation of different text samples within a single chunk.

However, it’s important to note that this behavior is a result of the training process and the structure of the training data, rather than an explicit rule that the model is programmed to follow. The model doesn’t “know” about the [EOS] token in the same way that a human would understand it. Instead, it learns patterns in the data, and one of those patterns is that the context often changes after an [EOS] token. This is part of the reason why these models are able to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text, even when dealing with concatenated text samples that span different contexts.

How about long context LLM? say 128k context. since the context is so long, adding a large batch seems to be challenging.
Copilot
由 Copilot 发送:
Indeed, training a large language model (LLM) with a long context, such as 128k tokens, presents several challenges.

Memory Constraints: The primary challenge is the memory constraint of the hardware (typically GPUs) used for training. Storing a large number of long sequences in memory during training can be difficult.
Computational Complexity: The computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism used in models like GPT-2, GPT-3, or GPT-4 scales quadratically with the sequence length. This means that doubling the context length more than quadruples the computation time.
Batch Size: As you pointed out, with a longer context, the batch size (number of sequences processed in parallel) would have to be reduced due to memory constraints, which can slow down the training process and affect the model’s performance.
To address these challenges, researchers use various strategies:

Model Parallelism: This involves distributing the model’s parameters across multiple GPUs, allowing the model to handle longer sequences.
Gradient Checkpointing: This technique reduces memory usage during training by storing only a subset of the intermediate activations in the forward pass and recomputing the rest during the backward pass.
Sparse Attention Mechanisms: These mechanisms reduce the computational complexity of the attention operation from quadratic to linear, enabling the model to handle longer sequences.
Reversible Layers: These allow the model to reconstruct the activations in the backward pass, reducing memory usage.
Despite these strategies, training LLMs with very long contexts remains a challenging and active area of research. The trade-off between context length, batch size, and computational resources is a key consideration in the design and training of these models.

Is there any model is only using chunking? That is, during training, each sample is either chunked from a coherent context (single text src), or pad to the max context len.
Copilot
由 Copilot 发送:
Yes, there are models that use only chunking during training. In these models, each sample is a chunk from a coherent context (a single text source), and if a sample is shorter than the maximum context length, it is padded to reach that length.

For example, in the case of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants (like LSTMs and GRUs), the training data is often chunked into sequences of a fixed length. Each sequence is treated as a separate sample with its own context. If a sequence is shorter than the maximum context length, it is typically padded with zeros (or some other designated padding token) to reach the maximum length.

This approach simplifies the training process and reduces the computational requirements, as the model only needs to process fixed-length sequences. However, it also means that the model may not be able to fully utilize the context information if the context spans multiple chunks.

It’s important to note that this approach is more commonly used in models that do not use the Transformer architecture (like GPT-2, GPT-3, or GPT-4). Transformer-based models typically use both chunking and concatenation, as I mentioned in my previous responses. This allows them to better handle long sequences and utilize context information across different text sources. But the trade-off is increased computational complexity and memory requirements.

For model trained with concat. If each sentence is ended with [EOS], then how will the model behave when multiple sentences have coherent context? Does it learn to attend accross [EOS] tokens conditionally?
Copilot
由 Copilot 发送:
Yes, models trained with concatenated sentences can learn to attend across [EOS] tokens conditionally, depending on the context and the specific patterns in the training data.

In general, the [EOS] token is used to indicate the end of a sentence or a sequence, and the model learns to associate it with a transition in context. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the model will always “ignore” the context before an [EOS] token when predicting the next token. The attention mechanism in Transformer-based models like GPT-2, GPT-3, or GPT-4 allows the model to consider all previous tokens in the sequence when making a prediction, not just the tokens since the last [EOS].

So, if the training data contains many examples of coherent contexts spanning multiple sentences (i.e., the context after an [EOS] token is often related to the context before it), the model could potentially learn to attend across [EOS] tokens when it’s beneficial for making accurate predictions.

However, it’s important to note that this behavior is not guaranteed and can depend on many factors, including the specifics of the training data and the model architecture. Also, while the model has the ability to attend across [EOS] tokens, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will always do so. The model’s attention patterns are learned from the data and can vary depending on the context.

In practice, understanding the exact behavior of these models can be quite complex and is an active area of research in the field of natural language processing.

How will the concat affect the behavior on generation? Will it learn to generate [EOS] conditionally on context end or it just generate [EOS] on every sentences end. If it is the latter, how can the user/developer tell if he should stop sampling if a [EOS] is produced?
Copilot
由 Copilot 发送:
The concatenation of sentences during training can indeed affect the behavior of the model during generation. Here’s how:

Generation of [EOS] Tokens: Models like GPT-2, GPT-3, or GPT-4 are trained to predict the next token in a sequence given the previous tokens. If the model has been trained on data where each sentence is ended with an [EOS] token, it will learn to generate an [EOS] token at the end of each sentence. This is because it has learned from the training data that sentences typically end with an [EOS] token.
Conditional Generation of [EOS] Tokens: The model could potentially learn to generate [EOS] tokens conditionally, based on the context. For example, if the training data contains many examples of sentences that end without an [EOS] token when they are followed by a related sentence, the model might learn to sometimes generate sentences without an [EOS] token in such contexts. However, this behavior would depend on the specifics of the training data and the model architecture.
Determining When to Stop Sampling: If the model generates an [EOS] token, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the generated text is complete. The [EOS] token simply indicates the end of a sentence, not the end of the entire text. Therefore, the user or developer cannot rely solely on the generation of an [EOS] token to determine when to stop sampling. Instead, they might need to use additional heuristics or criteria, such as a maximum length for the generated text or a specific ending token or phrase.
In practice, controlling the generation behavior of these models can be quite complex and is an active area of research. There are various techniques for influencing the model’s output, such as adjusting the temperature parameter, using top-k or nucleus sampling, or fine-tuning the model on a specific task. However, these techniques come with their own trade-offs and challenges.

So after above discussion, it seems that we better put [EOS] on context end. This ease both the model training and inference.
Copilot
由 Copilot 发送:
Yes, you’re correct. Placing an [EOS] token at the end of each context during training can indeed simplify both the training and inference processes for large language models like GPT-2, GPT-3, or GPT-4.

During training, the [EOS] token helps the model understand where one context ends and another begins, especially when multiple contexts are concatenated together. This can make it easier for the model to learn the structure of the data and make accurate predictions.

During inference or generation, the [EOS] token can serve as a clear signal that the model has completed a thought or idea. This can make the generated text easier to interpret and can also provide a natural place to stop the generation process if needed.

However, it’s important to note that the effectiveness of this approach can depend on the specifics of the training data and the task at hand. For some tasks or datasets, other approaches might be more effective. As with many aspects of machine learning, it often comes down to a process of experimentation and iterative refinement to find the best approach for a given situation.
